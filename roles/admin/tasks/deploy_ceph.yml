# btrfs also incorporates multi-device management into the file system, which
# enables you to support heterogeneous disk storage infrastructure, data allocation
# policies. The community also aims to provide fsck, deduplication, and data
# encryption support in the future. This compelling list of features makes btrfs
# the ideal choice for Ceph clusters.
